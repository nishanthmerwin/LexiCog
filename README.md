# LexiCog Outline

LexiCog is a natural language processing application that interacts with email databases to provide users a time dependent look into their language usage and it's relation to mental health. For this class project, the work is going to be split into the following working groups as shown below

### Email API and Data extraction

The people in this group are resopnsible for learning microsoft outlook and/or gmail's API to extract email data. Ideally, users should be able to clock on a button which prompts them to sign in to gmail / outlook and then the app should look into all their sent emails.

The data should be returned in a set format (we can discuss this further).

A sample dataset is found here: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/ (perhaps this can be the output format?)


### Summary Statistics

This group is responsible for all the natural language processing and generating data that is useful for the user. All the data for this will be taken in according from the data format decided with the email API group.

Data must be formatted as time series. Rows represent a time point, columns represent summary statistics.

### Data visualization

Data construction and plots can be generated in whatever language developers are comforatble in. Takes in data from previous group and generates plot. Must be visually appealing, informative and reproducible.

### App graphic design

This group will focus on the aesthetics of the app. Everything ranging from the logo design to the the actual layout of the app, haptic feedback, etc. Basically its the entire user experience.

### iOS / Android Development tools

This group will learn about the various frameworks required to create and deploy mobile apps. This group can also look into web apps if interested.
